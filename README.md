# Financial-Model-Walmart

If we want to invest in Walmart, how do we determine the viability of this investment?

In order to ensure profitability fro a stock investment, we need to understand the future stock prices of Walmart

Here we use  technical amalysis to help detemine and predict stock prices of business
determine the potential value of the stock.

 This technical analysis is based on three methods:
 1. Comparable company analysis
 2. Discounted cash flow analysis
 3. Precedent transaction analysis

we will build and 
construct all three of the listed analyses and all the supporting analyses exactly as a Wall Street analyst would. We will then have the ability to interpret from the analysis if Walmart is undervalued, overvalued, or appropriately valued

 We will analyze the company’s historical performance and step through techniques to make accurate projections of the business’s future performance.
Once we have a good understanding of Walmart’s past and future 
performance, Part Two will help us interpret the company’s financials into 
a valuation analysis using the methods mentioned previously. 

 Valuation 
techniques are based on a summary of the company’s performance.
